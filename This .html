    <h2>ðŸ’Œ My Heartfelt Letter</h2>
    <p>You are in almost every thought of mine throughout the day. I miss you so much my love. I try to remember that when I miss you, it means I'm lucky, because I have someone worth missing so much. It's a reminder of the amount of love that I have for you.</p>
    <p>My sweet compassionate short lightskin Xhosa. The one with whom my inhliziyo belongs. I think of you as soon as I wake up, and you're always the last thought of mine before I go to sleep.</p>
    <p>I hope you know that my love for you has not changed, with the exception of it growing stronger. I want you to feel so accomplished, and so seen, that your cheeks hurt from all the smiles you have. You're my baby. My love. My sthandwa.</p>
    <p>I care about your happiness baby. I want to hear about your day, your feelings, the things that frustrated you, the things that were heavy. I want to hear about the things that make you smile. The things you're proud of.</p>
    <p>I hope so much that I can be a reason you smile, every single day. And imma do my best to make that happen. Ngiyakuthanda yezwa.</p>
